    <h1> MY RESUME </h1>
    <p> My name is Gift Ezra Ifeanyi <br> i hail from delta state nigeria, born on the 19th day of march 1994. <br>born into a family of 5, i am the 4th child and second son. i was born into a christian family and was rasied as a jehovahs witness which means that i was raised with good morals and sound biblical values. <br>
    i began my education at age 8 and had my junior school leaving certificate in 2005, I had my senior school certifictate in 2012, the gap being delays caused by some life circumstances.  <br>
    in 2013 i gained admission into the university of benin to study geography and estate management. i got my degree in the year 2018, and went into business full-time. <br> my dada passed in the year 2017 and that left me with lot of responsibilities which i managed to sort out by taking on multiple jobs while studying.<br>
    so far i have managed to grow my business to the point where i import items from china.then i decided to come to the uk to pursue my major career which is computing and its related fields. got an offer from RGU and decided to take my chances. <br>
    like every hurdle i have crossed in life, studying here would really help build my dream life and give me a sharp edge against all odds.</p>
